# KnorrStats

### About
Knorrstats is an application used for visualizing data from a game team run by me, Aleksey Panas, together with a few friends. The data shows our performance over the course of months and allows for much customization

### Software Contents
The project consists of 3 parts:
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Contains tables which store data
- **NodeJS Express Web Server and Frontend Website:** Communicates with database and shows data visualizations
- **Python Client build in Pygame:** Communicates with webserver and is used to enter data

### Development Progress
The project is still unfinished and is being worked on. Approximate progress shown below:
- > Client 50% 
- > Database 100%
- > Webserver 5%
